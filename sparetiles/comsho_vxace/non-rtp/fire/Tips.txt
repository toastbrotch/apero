- Please make the flame animation speed to normal about 4 times.
When setting three flames, one is normal, one is double, one is quadruple, etc.
It will look more natural if you set them apart.

- Smoke looks good if the speed is slower than flame.
Change the stepping speed according to your liking.

- A separate event is made automatically by "Set Movement Route" > "(specify flame or smoke event)" >
If you use "Change Blend Mode" with "Screen" or "Additive" You can make the flames look more intense.
